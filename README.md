- I'm able to send a friendship invitation.

- I can see a button “Invite to friendship” next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users’ list and single user page.

- I'm able to see pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users.

- I'm able to accept or reject friendships invitation.

- I'm able to create new posts (text only).
